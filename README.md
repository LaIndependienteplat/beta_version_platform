# Platform implementation using AWS EC2 instance
The following is a project to build a platform where users can get a registration and then use some of the features implemented in one section of the platform called communities. In this section, users can share any kind of opinion and thoughts about their daily work on crowdwork platforms. Also, the platform is focused on integrating users from all possible regions of Latin America.

Another exciting feature in this section is the implementation of agent assistant, which has the task of helping users to find recommendations about their main interests, to make this possible, this agent assistant makes use of all the information recorded in a database and also with the help of a third party to complete the main task of this agent assistant.

The platform also contains a section with information about some topics that seem to interest the users of the platform.
